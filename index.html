        <h1> My favorite hobby is Skateboarding </h1>
        <hr>
        <p> My favorite hobby is skateboarding when I have free time. I like that skateboarding is, so challenging and that there is so many cool tricks that I can learn. I like to skateboard with my friends as they rollerskate and I practice every day. I started skateboarding on my birthday because I got the skate board for my birthday, but I took a 2 month break and then I started skateboarding again. I am still a beginner because I am trying to teach myself how to skateboard. Overall, it is really fun to skateboard and I love practicing it every day.</p>
